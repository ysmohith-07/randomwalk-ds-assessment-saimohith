## Questions:

Q1: How many rows and columns are there in books.csv dataset?

Q2: How many books do not have an original title?

Q3: How many unique books are present in the dataset ? Evaluate based on the 'book_id' after removing null values in the original_title column.

Q4: What is the average rating of all the books in the dataset based on ‘average_rating’?

Q5: Find the number of books published in the year ‘2000’ based on the ‘original_publication_year’.

Q6: Which book (title) has the maximum number of ratings based on ‘work_ratings_count’.

Q7: Bucket the average_rating of books into 11 buckets [0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0] with 0.5 decimal rounding (eg: average_rating 3.0 to 3.49 will fall in bucket 3.0). Plot bar graph to show total number of books in each rating bucket.
